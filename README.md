My song is entitled "Delirium", which is representative of the hectic and quick-paced semester we have had. My song aims to provide some sense of serenity, but similar to this semester, it can be unpredictable at times. The live loop for the beat does not always work in time with the melody that is playing, which can be unnerving, but the resolution when they sync up should be cathartic. My song is built on a live-loop beat, with an additional layer that plays intermittently.There is a beginning groove in C major, and two melodies: one that plays in C major, and repeats a third and fifth above the root, and the second one also plays in C major, but repeats in the chord progression of I, IV, V, I.
